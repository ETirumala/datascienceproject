Python Token:
    it is basic component of the source code. A character cateagorize in to four class of token they are
        Keyword
        Identifiers
        LIterals
        Operators
    
    KEYWORDS:
    python keywords are special reserved words.
    Each Keywords have a special meaning and a specific operation
        True     Class       finally    is       return
        False    continue    for        lambda   try
        None     def         from       nonlocal while
        and      del         global     not      with
        as       elif        if         or       yield
        assert   else        import     pass
        break    except      in         raise
         
    Rules for keywords:
        we cannot use a keyword as variable name, function name or any other identifier.
        In python, Keywords are CASE SENSITIVE.
        All the Keywords except TRUE FALSE NONE are in lowercase and they must be written as it is.
        
    Example for Keywords
        
        To Get the list of keywords of latest version by using below code
        
            import keyword
            print (keyword.kwlist)
            
            output:
            ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else',                'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise',                'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
            
        Description of Keywords
        
            TRUE AND FALSE:
            
                This keywords are truth values of Python. This keys are results of comparision operations or logical(Boolean) operations in 
                python.
                    For Example:
                       
                       1 == 1
                       True
                       
                       5>3
                       True
                       
                       10<=1
                       False
                       
                       3>7
                       False
                       
                       True or False
                       True
                       
                       True and False
                       False
                       
               True and False in python is same as 1 and 0 this can be followed example
                       
                       True == 1
                       True
                       
                       True == 0
                       False
                       
                       False == 1
                       False
                       
                       False == 0
                       True
                       
                       True + True 
                       2
                       
                       True + False
                       1
                       
                       False + True
                       1
                       
                       False + FAlse
                       0
                
                       
            NONE :
                None is a Constant in python that represents the absence of a value or a null value.
                It is an object of its own datatype, the NoneType. We cannot create multiple None objects but can assign it to variables.                   These variables will be equal to one another.

                We must take special care that None does not imply False, 0 or any empty list, dictionary, string etc. For example:
                
                None == 0
                
                None == 1
                
                None == False
                
                Output :
                False
                False
                False
                
                x = none
                y = none
                x == y
                
     IDENTIFIRES(NAMES):
        These Names are the Unique name that assign and used to identify a variable, function, class or and object. It helps differentiating
        one entity from another.

        Rules For Writing Identifiers

            1.Identifiers can be a combination of letter in lowercase(a to z) or uppercase(A - Z) or digits(0-9) or an undersscore(_).
                Example:
                    Names like 
                    myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen.

            2.Keywords cannot be used as identifiers name.
            3.Python is case sensitive.
            4.We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc.in our identifier.
            5.1st charchter can be (_)underscore but not be a digit
            6.idenifier can be any lenght.               
                
        LITERALS: Constant used in python. Literals are a data Given in a variable called constant. There are four literals they are
            String Literals
            Numeric Literals
            Boolean Literals
            Special Literals
            
        String Literals: 
            
            Enclosing a text in the quotes.
            both single and double quotes can be used.
                
                Example :
                # String Literals
                name = "Victory"
                name = 'Victory'
                
                multine = '''this is example for 
                multiline
                block'''
                print(multine)
