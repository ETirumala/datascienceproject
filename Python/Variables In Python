Variable In Python:
    How do you think the value is assigned?
        Assigning Value
        Multiple Assignment
    Assigning Single value to a variable:
        specifying the name of the variable python will automaticaly detect the datatype of a variable. But in orher language like c, c++, java this feature will not accept
        
        Example:
        a = 10
        name = 'Victor'
        salary = 20000.30
    Multiple Assignment value to a variable
          
        
        Example:
        #same values for multiple variable
        a = 10
        b = 10
        c = 10
        a=b=c =10
        #diferrent values for multiple variable
        x = 20
        y = 30
        z = 40
        x,y,z =20,30,40

        print(x,z)
