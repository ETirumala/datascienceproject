PYTHON PROGRAM STRUCTURE

    Python program contains various components like:
        a.Expressions
        b.Statements
        c.Comments
        d.Function
        e.Blocks and Indentation
        
        Expressions:
            An Expression is any legal combination of symbols that represents a value
            For eg:
             a = 15
             
        Statements:
            instructions that a python interpreter can execute are called statements.
            
            A statement is a programming instruction that does something i.e.,
            some action takes place.
            
            a=10 ----------------------------------------------> These are
            print(a); -----------------------------------------> Statements
            
        
        Comments:
            Comments are the additional redable infromation to clarify the source code.
            Comments are ignored by the pyhton interpreter but it can be read by the programmer
            comments in python begin with symbol # or '" . comments enclosed in triple quotes are called docstring.
            
            Single Line Comment:
            
            #(hash) Symbol is used  to start writting comment.
            
                # this is a comment
                
           Multi Line Comment :
           
           """ triple single qutoe or double code is used to write multiple line comment.
               
               ''' this is a 
               multiple comment
               line includes '''
               
          Function
              A function is a code that has a name and can it is reused by specifiing its name in the program, where needed.
              
              eg: # Function
                   drink = "water"
                   food = "Eat"
                   sit = "Table"
                   def menu(x):
                       if x == drink:
                            print(drink);
                            print("Prints only if conditon is TRUE");
                        else:
                            print(food);
                            print("Prints only if condition is FALSE");
                    print(sit);
                    menu(drink)
