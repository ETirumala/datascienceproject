OPERATORS

    . operators are tokens that trigger some computation when applied to variables and other objects in an expression.
    . operators requires oprends to work upon
    . it is special symbols in python that carry out arithematic or logical computation.
    . The value that operator oprates on is called the operand.
    
    For Example
    
    >>> 2+3
    It requires two types of operators:
        Unary Operators (+,-,~, not)
        Binary Operators
            Arithemetic Operator (+,-,*,/,%,**,//)
            Relational Operator (<,>,<=,>=,==,!=)
            Logical Operator (and, or, not)
            Bitwise Operator (&,^, |,<<,>>)
            Assignment Operator (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=)
            Identity Operator (is, not is)
            Membership Operator (in, not in)

Punctuators
        . Punctuators are symbols that are used in programming language to organize sentence structure and indicate the rythms and emphasis of expressions, statements and program structure.
        . Most common Punctuators are :
        ' " # \ () [] {} @ , . : = ;
