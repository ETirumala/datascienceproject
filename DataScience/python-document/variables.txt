PYTHON VARIABLES :
    A variable is a memory address that can change and when the memory address cannot change then that variable is known as a constant.
    variable is a name of the memory location where data is stored.
    The space is allocated in memory when a variable is stored.
    
        Creating and Declaring a Variable
        Re-declaring a Variable
        Local Variable
        Global Variable
        Deleting a Variable
        Concatenating Variables
        Constants
        
CREATING VARIABLES:
     variables are continers for storing data values. Variables are created by assigning a value to it.      
        For Ex:
            a = 10
            b = 'priya'
            c = 10.56
            print(a)
            print(b)
            print(c)
      
      The assigned value can be any data type. variables do not need to be decleared with any particular type and can even change type           after they have been set.
      
        For Ex:
            a = 10 # a is of type int
            a = 'sp'# a is now type of str
            print(a) # it will print updated value
          
      String variables can be decleared in single or double quotes.
       
            b = 'priya'
            d = 'bm'
            print(b,d)
          
VARIABLES NAMES:
    variables can be shortname, Descriptive name.
        For Ex:
            short name (a,x,y,b)
            descriptive(name, diname)

RULES FOR PYTHON VARIABLES:
    A variables name must start with name or the underscore but cannot start with number.
        For Ex:
            a = 'priya'
            _a = 'bm'
            1acb ='sp'
            print(a)
            print(_a)
            print(1acb)
            
    Variables are Case-Sensitive 
    
        For Ex:
            a = 'priya'
            print(A)
                It gives error 
                ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
                <ipython-input-9-4c13c990a2fb> in <module>
                1 a = 'priya'
                ----> 2 print(A)

                NameError: name 'A' is not defined
                
           print(a)
           
     Python Variables are always assigned using the equal to sign followed by the value of the variable.
         
         

ASSIGN VALUE TO MULTIPLE VARIABLES:
    python allows you to assign multiple values in a single line.
        For Ex:
            a,b,c = 'priya','bm','sathya'
            print(a,b,c)
            
            Output: priya bm sathya
            
    When we assign multiple values in a single line and if one value is missed it gives error.
        For Ex:
            a,b,c = 'priya','bm'
            print(a,b,c)
            
        output :
        
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
        <ipython-input-13-5b82fa2d0b26> in <module>
        ----> 1 a,b,c = 'priya','bm'
        2 print(a,b,c)

        ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)
        
    Assigning Single value to multiple variables in one line 
        For Ex:
            x=y=z = 'sp'
            print(x)
            print(y)
            print(z)
        output:
            sp
            sp
            sp

OUTPUT VARIABLES:
    print statement is unique word to give output. 
       For Ex:
           x='Awesome'
           print("python is " +x)
    + character to add a variable to another variable:
        For Ex:
            ='Python is'
            y='Execllent programer'
            _a = x + y
            print(_a)
            
    For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
        For Ex:
            a = 10
            b = 20
            print(a+b)
print multilines 
    For Ex:
        print(''' printing output as multiple lines 
        what about the output variable''')
