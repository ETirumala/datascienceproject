Datatypes in Python:
    
    Datatypes are actually classes and variables are instance of the classees
    
    There are various data types in Python. Some of the importanttypes are listed below.
    
PYTHON NUMBERS:

        Integers, Floating point numbers and complex numbers falls under python numbers category. They are defined as int, float and complex class in python.
        
        We can use the type() function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to and the isinstance() function to check if an object belongs to a particular class.
            
            Example:
            a = 5
            print(a, "is of type", type(a))
            
            a=2.0
            print(a,"is of type", type(a)))
            
            a=1+2j
            print(a, "is complex number?@, isinstance(1+2j,complex))
            
            
        integers of any length, it is only limited by the memory available
        
        A Floating pointnumber is accurate upto 15 decimaal places. Integer and floating points are seprated by decimals points.1 is integer, 1.0 is floating point number.
        
        Complex numbers are written in the form, x+yj, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part.
            
            Examples:
            b = 2147589654233
            b
            o/p:2147589654233
            
            c = 1.247589654485558
            c
            o/p: 1.247589654485558
            
            
            d = 5+6j
            d
            (5+6j)
            
            
PYTHON LIST:
    It is one of the most used datatype in Python and isvery flexible.
    All the items in alist do not be of the dame type.
    Items are seprated by commas areenclosed within square brackets []
    
        Example:
        a = [1,2.2,'python']
        
        a = [5,10,15.258,priya,24,30,tiru]
        
        We can use the slicing operator[] to extract an item or a range of items from a list. Index starts from 0 in Python.
        
        #a[1]
        print("a[1]= ",a[1])
        
        o/p: a[1]=  10
        
        #a[3:5]
        print("a[3:5] = ",a[3:6])
        
        o/p: a[3:5] =  ['priya', 24, 30]
        
        #a[0:]
        print("a[0:] = ",a[0:])
        
        o/p:a[0:] =  [5, 10, 15.258, 'priya', 24, 30, 'tiru']
