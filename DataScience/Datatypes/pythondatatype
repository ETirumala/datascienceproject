Datatypes in Python:
        Datatypes are actually classes and variables are instance of the classees
        There are various data types in Python. Some of the importanttypes are listed below.
        Datatypes are categorised into 2 they are
            1.Immutable Datatype
            2.Mmutable Datatype
    
IMMUTABLE DATATYPE:
    PYTHON NUMBERS:

        Integers, Floating point numbers and complex numbers falls under python numbers category. They are defined as int, float and               complex class in python.
        
        We can use the type() function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to and the isinstance() function to check if an             object belongs to a particular class.
            
            Example:
            a = 5
            print(a, "is of type", type(a))
            
            a=2.0
            print(a,"is of type", type(a)))
            
            a=1+2j
            print(a, "is complex number?@, isinstance(1+2j,complex))
            
            
        integers of any length, it is only limited by the memory available
        
        A Floating pointnumber is accurate upto 15 decimaal places. Integer and floating points are seprated by decimals points.1 is                 integer, 1.0 is floating point number.
        
        Complex numbers are written in the form, x+yj, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part.
            
            Examples:
            b = 2147589654233
            b
            o/p:2147589654233
            
            c = 1.247589654485558
            c
            o/p: 1.247589654485558
            
            
            d = 5+6j
            d
            (5+6j)
            
    PYTHON STRING:
        String is sequence of unicode characters. we can use single quotes or double quotes to represents strings. 
        Multi-Line Strings can be denoted using triple quotes, ''' or """
        
            Example : 
        
            s = "text matter of a document or publication in any form. Content is both information and communication: the sum total of the               freshness, readability, relevancy, and usefulness of the information presented, and the manner in which it is presented."
        
            print("s[20:40] =",  s[20:40])
        
            # s[6:11] = 'world'
            print("s[6:11] = ", s[6:11])

            # Generates error
            # Strings are immutable in Python
            s[5] ='d'    

    PYTHON TUPLE:
        Tuple is an ordered sequnce of items same as list, 
        the only difference is the tuples are immutable.
        If tuples are once created cannot be modified.
        
        Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than list as it cannot change dynamically.
        
        It is defined within parantheses() where items are seprated by commas.
            Example:
            sp = (14785, 'You received this email to let you know about important changes to your Google Account and services' 8+90j)
            print(sp)
            print("sp[1:] =", sp[1:])
        
        
        
MMUTABLE DATATYPE:
    PYTHON LIST:
        It is one of the most used datatype in Python and isvery flexible.
        All the items in alist do not be of the dame type.
        Items are seprated by commas areenclosed within square brackets []
    
            Example:
            a = [1,2.2,'python']
        
            a = [5,10,15.258,priya,24,30,tiru]

            We can use the slicing operator[] to extract an item or a range of items from a list. Index starts from 0 in Python.

            #a[1]
            print("a[1]= ",a[1])

            o/p: a[1]=  10

            #a[3:5]
            print("a[3:5] = ",a[3:6])

            o/p: a[3:5] =  ['priya', 24, 30]

            #a[0:]
            print("a[0:] = ",a[0:])

            o/p:a[0:] =  [5, 10, 15.258, 'priya', 24, 30, 'tiru']
            

    PYTHON DICTIONARIES:
        Dicitonary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs
        
        It is generally used when we have a huge amount of data. 
        Dictionaries are optimized for retrieving data.
        we must know the key to retrieve the value.
        
        In python, Dictionaries are defined within braces {} with each item being a pair in the form of key:value. 
        Key and Value can be of any type.
            
            Example:
            
            pm = {1:'this is my first dictionary created',2:25893324, 3:'nothing'}
            print(type(pm))
            print("pm[3] =", pm[3])
            pm[3]='90+100j'
            
            output:
            <class 'dict'>
            pm[3] = nothing
            pm[3] = 90+100j
            
            
    PYTHON SET:
        Set is an unordered collection of unique items.
        Set is defined by values separated by comma inside brace{}.
            
            Example:
            a = {4,5.5,8,9,75}
            
            #printing set variable a
            print("a =", a)
            print(type(a))
