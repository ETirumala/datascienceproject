DATATYPES:
    To Know the which type of variables.
        for example:
            msg = "My Pc is Known as Lenovo"
            print(msg)
            print(type(msg))--------------- when we use aas type it will show the which datatype is using in the code.
        Output :
            My Pc is Known as Lenovo
            <class 'str'>------------------- class means a datatype

        Example for Number:
            a = 1043
            print(a)
            print(type(a))
        Output:
            1043
            <class 'int'>
            
        Example for Float Number:
            b = 1043.59
            print(b)
            print(type(b))
        Output:
            1043.59
            <class 'float'>
            
        Example for string
            Features of the string
               1.storing the value in a variable ?
                The values are stored in the format of indexing from 
                0  to alloted word. It will accept spaces while counting.
                
                var = "my pc is known as Lenovo"
                print(type(var))
                print(var[0:8])
        Output:
                <class 'str'>
                 pc is k

               2.Finding the value in string. It will gives the output as stored memorylocation
                     str='Lenovo configration'
                     str.find('ra')
                     str.find('ration')
        Output:
                    13
                    
               3.Replaceing the word in the data
                     str.replace('ration','ure')
                     outout: 'Lenovo configure'
               
               4.cleanup the data and spliting with ',' and inserting into the list
                     str1='test1,test2,test3'
                     str1.split(',')
               
               5.Tuples : In tuples the values are assigned in form of set
                   teacherdata = ('Reena', 'Rahul','Priya','Lavanya')
                   print(teacherdata)
                    
               
                   
               `
